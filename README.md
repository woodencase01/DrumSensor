# DrumSensor
Open source drum pad and drum module.

## Idea
* Each drum pad has it's own signal processing unit
* Each pad can be daisy-chained to simplify cable management
* Each pad has a frame sensor to avoid any cross-talk
* Most pad can sense the struck position

## Features and progress
* Configuration (Pad type, threshold) - 50%
* Communication between modules - 25%
* Interpolating strike position - 0%
* Manage frame sensor - 0%
